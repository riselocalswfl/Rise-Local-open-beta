adminAuditLogs	Admin.tsx, routes.ts	Admin accountability
sessions	replitAuth.ts	Required for auth
LEGACY/UNUSED (E-commerce & Old Vendor Types)
Table	Evidence	Status
restaurants	Only in migrations, seed scripts, validate-ownership	DEPRECATED - migrated to vendors
serviceProviders	Only in migrations, seed scripts	DEPRECATED - migrated to vendors
products	storage.ts has methods, minimal route usage	UNUSED - e-commerce removed
orders	storage.ts has methods, no active routes	UNUSED - e-commerce removed
orderItems	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
masterOrders	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
vendorOrders	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
events	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED - events feature disabled
eventRsvps	Only seed scripts	UNUSED
attendances	Only storage interface	UNUSED
menuItems	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
restaurantReviews	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
restaurantFAQs	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
vendorReviews	seed.ts only	UNUSED
vendorFAQs	seed.ts only	UNUSED
serviceOfferings	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
serviceBookings	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
spotlight	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED - replaced by preferredPlacements
messages	Old messaging system	DEPRECATED - replaced by conversations
reservations	storage.ts has methods	UNUSED
Step 3: Newest System of Record
Domain	Canonical Table/Fields
Users/Auth	users.id, users.email, users.isAdmin, users.isVendor
Rise Local Pass	users.isPassMember, users.passExpiresAt, users.stripeCustomerId, users.stripeSubscriptionId, users.membershipStatus
Deals	deals.* (tier, isPassLocked, status, redemptionFrequency)
Redemptions	dealRedemptions.status (redeemed/voided), dealRedemptions.redeemedAt
Vendors	vendors.* (unified table with vendorType: shop/dine/service)
Categories	categories.key, categories.label
Messaging	conversations + conversationMessages (NOT messages)
Step 4: Classification Lists
✅ KEEP (24 tables)
sessions, users, categories, vendors, deals, dealRedemptions, 
favorites, conversations, conversationMessages, notifications, 
emailJobs, membershipEvents, stripeWebhookEvents, preferredPlacements, 
placementImpressions, placementClicks, adminAuditLogs
⚠️ DEPRECATE (Keep for now, but stop writing new code against)
restaurants       - Migrated to vendors (vendorType='dine')
serviceProviders  - Migrated to vendors (vendorType='service')
messages          - Replaced by conversations/conversationMessages
spotlight         - Replaced by preferredPlacements
Reason: These may contain legacy data but are no longer the source of truth.

🗑️ SAFE TO REMOVE (After backup)
products, orders, orderItems, masterOrders, vendorOrders
events, eventRsvps, attendances
menuItems, restaurantReviews, restaurantFAQs
vendorReviews, vendorFAQs
serviceOfferings, serviceBookings
reservations
Reason: E-commerce, events, reviews, and service booking features are not in the current app. No active frontend routes use them.

Step 5: DB Cleanup Plan
Would you like me to create a detailed task list for the cleanup? Here's what it would include:

Code cleanup first - Remove unused storage methods, routes, and frontend pages
Schema cleanup - Create a migration to drop unused tables
Safety plan - Backup strategy and test checklist
