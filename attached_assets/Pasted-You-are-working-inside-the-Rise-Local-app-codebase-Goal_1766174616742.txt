You are working inside the Rise Local app codebase.

Goal: Ensure that all business onboarding and account creation elements are fully unified and displayed consistently across:
	•	Business onboarding flow
	•	Business dashboard
	•	Business account settings (“My Account”)

1. Terminology Standardization
	•	Replace all instances of the word “vendor” with “business” throughout the app:
	•	UI text
	•	Form labels
	•	Routes
	•	Component names
	•	Database field labels (display-only, not breaking schema)
	•	Dashboard headings
	•	User-facing language should always say Business, never Vendor.

2. Single Source of Truth for Business Profile Data
	•	Create (or confirm) one canonical Business Profile object that is used by:
	•	Onboarding forms
	•	Business dashboard
	•	Account settings
	•	Public business profile page
	•	All views should read from and write to the same data source, not duplicates.

3. Unified Business Profile Fields

Ensure the following fields appear identically in onboarding, dashboard, and settings:
	•	Business name
	•	Profile photo
	•	Banner image
	•	Business category (shop, restaurant, service, etc.)
	•	Short description / bio
	•	Contact info (email, phone)
	•	Website
	•	Social media links
	•	Address + service area
	•	Business hours
	•	Menu or offerings (if applicable)
	•	Deals associated with the business

Field order, labels, and required/optional status should be consistent everywhere.

4. Dashboard + “My Account” Structure
	•	Move all business management tools into My Account
	•	Business users should see:
	•	Profile Settings
	•	Deals Management
	•	Billing / Plan
	•	Visibility / Status
	•	Remove any separate “For Businesses” dashboard entry points

5. Component Reuse
	•	Reuse the same form components for:
	•	Onboarding
	•	Editing profile in dashboard
	•	Editing profile in settings
	•	Do not create parallel forms or duplicated logic.

6. Data Integrity Rules
	•	Changes made in any location (onboarding, dashboard, settings) must:
	•	Instantly reflect everywhere else
	•	Update the public business profile correctly
	•	Prevent partial or conflicting profile states.

7. UX Expectations
	•	Business users should feel like onboarding → dashboard → settings is one continuous experience
	•	No repeated questions unless editing
	•	No mismatched wording or missing fields

Implement these changes without removing existing business data.
