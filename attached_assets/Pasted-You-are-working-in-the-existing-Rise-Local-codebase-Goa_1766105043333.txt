You are working in the existing Rise Local codebase.

Goal: On /discover, keep deals organized by value/intent sections, but do NOT separate member-only deals into their own section. Instead, member-only deals should appear mixed into the same lists as regular/free deals, with locking/blur behavior for non-members.

1) Keep top controls
	•	Keep location dropdown.
	•	Keep top filter pills:
	•	All Deals
	•	Member-Only
	•	Free Deals
	•	These filters determine which deals are included, but sections remain the same.

2) Discover section order (no “Exclusive Member Deals” section)

Render sections in this exact order (only show if it has results):
	1.	Best Value Near You
	•	Includes deals where computed savings >= $5
	•	Sort: savings desc, then distance asc
	•	Mixed: include both memberOnly and non-member deals (unless filtered out by top pill)
	2.	Use Today
	•	redeemableNow=true OR redeemWindow includes today
	•	Sort: distance asc, then newest
	•	Mixed deals
	3.	New Local Businesses
	•	Deals from vendors created within last 30 days OR vendor.isNew=true
	•	Sort newest vendor first
	•	Mixed deals
	4.	Popular With Locals
	•	Sort: redeemsLast7Days desc, then savesLast7Days desc, then distance asc
	•	Mixed deals
	5.	Browse by Category
	•	Chips/icons:
	•	Food & Drink
	•	Wellness & Fitness
	•	Home & Services
	•	Shopping & Retail
	•	Experiences
	•	Selected category filters sections 1–4

3) Locking + paywall behavior (critical)
	•	If a deal is memberOnly=true and user is NOT a Pass member:
	•	Render the deal card in the same list but:
	•	Apply blur/opacity overlay
	•	Show a lock icon + “Unlock with Rise Local Pass”
	•	Disable redeem action
	•	Tapping the card opens the existing Pass paywall modal/screen
	•	If user IS a Pass member:
	•	Card behaves normally.

4) Top filter pill behavior
	•	All Deals: show both memberOnly and non-member deals (mixed)
	•	Member-Only: show only memberOnly deals (still mixed into sections 1–4, but obviously all will be locked/unlocked depending on membership)
	•	Free Deals: show only deals where price=0 OR isFree=true (and exclude memberOnly unless the data model allows “free but member-only”; if both exist, treat it as memberOnly and lock it)

5) Deduplication + feed quality
	•	Do not show the same deal twice anywhere on the Discover page.
	•	Avoid showing the same vendor back-to-back when possible (simple interleave).
	•	Keep “See all” for sections 1–4 only; it navigates to a filtered list route (reuse if exists, otherwise create /deals?section=bestValue, etc.)

6) Savings computation helper

Implement computeSavings(deal):
	•	If deal.savingsAmount exists, use it.
	•	Else if percentOff and originalPrice exist: originalPrice * (percentOff/100)
	•	Else if isBOGO and itemPrice exists: savings = itemPrice
	•	Else savings = 0
Show badge: “Save $X” (rounded)

7) Pass CTA copy tweak

Change Pass CTA button text:
	•	From: “Join for $4.99/mo”
	•	To: “Unlock for $4.99/mo”
No pricing logic changes.

8) Implementation notes (must match current architecture)
	•	Router: wouter
	•	Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui
	•	Data: TanStack Query
	•	Auth: useAuth(); derive membership flag (use existing subscription status / field; if missing, implement isPassMember derived from user subscription)
	•	Create shared query base filters: location + radius + selected top filter + selected category
	•	Keep mobile-first performance; show skeleton loaders per section

Deliverables
	•	Updated /discover page implementing the mixed feed behavior.
	•	Updated deal card UI state for locked member-only deals.
	•	Helper utilities (computeSavings, dedupe/interleave).
	•	Minimal backend/API changes only if necessary.

Proceed to implement now.
