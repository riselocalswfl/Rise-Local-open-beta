Please redesign the /join page to keep the strengths of Replit’s clean, simple layout—but elevate it so it feels more branded, more intentional, and more visually appealing. I do NOT want a flashy redesign, but I also do NOT want a plain, boring, white-card layout. Please upgrade the UI with subtle creativity while keeping it clean and functional.

1. Keep Replit’s strengths

Maintain the clean spacing, modern fonts, and responsive structure.

Keep the two-column layout for Shop vs Sell.

Keep the buttons simple and intuitive.

Do not clutter the interface or add heavy graphics.

2. Add tasteful Rise Local personality (not overdone)

Add a soft, subtle background tone or texture (very light, not distracting).

Add a thin underline or accent bar under the main header using the Rise Local green (#7C9A67).

Use slightly rounded corners and soft shadows on the cards (not heavy, not flat).

Add a very subtle nature-inspired accent (small leaf icon, soft line art, or a faint gradient) to help differentiate the brand visually.

3. Improve visual hierarchy without making it flashy

Increase the headline size and spacing to feel more welcoming.

Make the two cards feel more distinct with spacing, shadow, and heading weight.

Improve bullet point spacing and add small icons to make them feel more lively.

Make the CTAs more visually prominent without being loud.

4. Add micro-interactions

Add a hover lift on cards (2–4px).

Add a small button hover effect (slight color change or shadow).

Make icons scale gently on hover.

5. Keep everything subtle and cohesive

The goal is a polished, unique, brand-aligned look that does NOT feel like a generic template.

Use creative accents sparingly.

Keep the layout clean, inviting, and professional.

6. Functionality stays EXACTLY the same

Do not change:

routing

buttons

structure

user flow

logic

Only adjust HTML and CSS to deliver a higher-quality but still clean and simple design.

Please rewrite the page styling using this balanced approach."**
