Refine the Rise Local Admin Dashboard to remove features that are not currently active or relevant and replace them with metrics that directly reflect platform traction, memberships, and deal usage.

Remove the following from the admin dashboard:

Listings

Events

Orders

Paid Orders

Revenue metrics tied to orders

These features are not currently core to Rise Local’s model and should not appear in the admin overview.

Add and prioritize the following dashboard metrics:
1. Deal Metrics (Core KPI)

Total Deals Created (all active deals)

Premium Deals (deals marked as Rise Local Pass–only)

Free/Public Deals (non-premium)

Deal Redemptions (Total)

Redemptions by Type

Premium deal redemptions

Free/public deal redemptions

Each metric should be clearly labeled and visually distinct.

2. Membership Metrics (Very High Priority)

Total Rise Local Pass Holders

Total Non-Pass Users

Conversion Rate (Pass holders ÷ total users)

3. Manual Admin Controls (Critical)

Add admin-only controls that allow:

Manually toggling a user between:

Rise Local Pass holder

Non-Pass user

Clearly show:

Current membership status

Date status was last updated

Whether status was Stripe-driven or manually overridden

Manual overrides should persist and not be overwritten by UI refreshes.

4. Business Participation Health

Total Businesses

Businesses with:

At least 1 active deal

At least 1 premium deal

Businesses with zero deals (flagged for outreach)

5. Dashboard UX Improvements

Reorder dashboard so Deals and Memberships appear first

Remove ecommerce-style language (orders, revenue)

Use simple, founder-readable labels (no corporate jargon)

Optimize for fast insight over volume of stats

Overall Goal:

This dashboard should help the founder instantly answer:

Are people buying the Rise Local Pass?

Are premium deals being used?

Are businesses actually participating?

Keep the UI clean, mobile-friendly, and aligned with Rise Local as a local deals + membership platform, not a marketplace or ordering app.

Do not add features that assume future commerce or events unless explicitly requested.
