1. Remove the old vendor profile setup

Remove the current single universal vendor profile layout.

Remove any areas where all vendors display products, menus, services, and events at the same time.

Remove any old tabs, sections, or fields that don’t fit with category-specific profiles.

Remove anything that forces all vendors to look the same, regardless of their category.

I want a clean slate with only the new structure below.

2. Create a single master vendor profile

This should only include the information that ALL vendor types share:

Business name

Vendor category (shop/events, dine, or services)

Tagline

About/description

Location

Hours

Payment options

Social links

Cover photo

Profile photo

Gallery photos

Values tags

“Message Vendor” button

“Follow Vendor” button

This master profile appears FIRST for everyone.

3. Add category-specific sections that appear ONLY for the correct vendor type
A. Shop & Events Vendors

Show these sections:

Products

Product details

Events they host or attend

Announcements

Policies (shipping, pickup, refunds)

Do NOT show menus or service offerings here.

B. Dine Vendors

Show these sections:

Menu (with categories)

Food/drink item descriptions

Any locally-sourced badges

Options for takeout, delivery, reservations

Popular dishes

Do NOT show product listings or service listings.

C. Service Vendors

Show these sections:

List of services (with price ranges and descriptions)

Booking or scheduling options

Packages

Service area map

Reviews

Do NOT show menus or product grids here.

4. Keep the layout consistent

Every vendor profile should follow this layout structure:

Overview → Main Category Section (Shop/Menu/Services) → Policies/Reviews → Contact

The middle section changes depending on vendor type.

5. Messaging requirements

Users must be able to message ANY vendor.

Vendors can only message users who have interacted with them (followed, purchased, or chatted).

Keep the “Message Vendor” button visible at the top of every profile.

6. Performance and simplicity

Keep all vendor-specific sections separate so only the appropriate content loads.

Do not duplicate full vendor profiles for each category — only the unique sections.

Make the system modular and user-friendly.

Final Goal

A vendor profile system that is clean, easy to use, and automatically adapts depending on whether the vendor is Shop/Events, Dine, or Services — without mixing features between categories.
