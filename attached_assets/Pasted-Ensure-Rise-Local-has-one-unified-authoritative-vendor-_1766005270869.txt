Ensure Rise Local has one unified, authoritative vendor profile data source that is created during vendor onboarding and reused everywhere in the app.

Requirements:

Single Source of Truth

Create or confirm a vendors table (or equivalent) that stores all vendor profile data collected during onboarding.

This record must be the only source for:

Business pages

Vendor profile pages

Deals listings

Search results

Discover / category views

Onboarding → Vendor Profile Link

When a vendor completes onboarding, automatically:

Create a vendor profile record

Associate it with the authenticated user via vendor.userId

Set onboardingComplete = true

Do NOT create duplicate or temporary vendor objects.

Consistent Navigation Flow

When a user clicks a business anywhere in the app (business card, deal, search result, spotlight, etc.):

Route to /vendor/:vendorId

Fetch vendor data only by vendorId

Never pass vendor info through props or hardcoded data

Profile Data Reuse

The vendor profile page must display the exact same data entered during onboarding:

Business name

Profile image

Banner image

Description

Category

Address / location

Contact info

Website & social links

Hours

Menus (if applicable)

Deals associated with that vendor

Editing Rules

Vendors can only edit their own profile

Any edits update the same vendor record (no new records created)

Changes must immediately reflect everywhere the vendor appears

Data Integrity Safeguards

Prevent multiple vendor profiles per user

If a vendor is missing a profile, redirect them to onboarding

If a user is not a vendor, block access to vendor edit routes

Developer Constraints

No duplicated vendor schemas

No mock vendor data in production routes

All business page links must resolve to a real vendor profile

Goal:
Create a clean, reliable backend flow where:

Onboarding creates the vendor profile

Every business click leads to the correct, legitimate vendor profile

Vendor data stays consistent across the entire Rise Local app
