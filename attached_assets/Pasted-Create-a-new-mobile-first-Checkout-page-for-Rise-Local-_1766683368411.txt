Create a new mobile-first Checkout page for Rise Local.

Context / constraints:
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript
- Router: wouter (NOT react-router)
- Routes live in: client/src/App.tsx
- App uses AuthBoundary and AppShell patterns already.
- This app is deals-focused (no ordering, no services, no events).
- Checkout is ONLY for purchasing Rise Local Pass subscriptions (monthly/yearly) or upgrading membership — not buying products from businesses.
- Keep styling consistent with Rise Local: clean white background, modern rounded cards, strong hierarchy, accessible text.
- Reuse existing UI components if present (buttons, inputs, cards). If none exist, implement simple components inline.
- Add a new route: /checkout

Checkout page requirements:
1) Page layout:
- Header: "Checkout"
- Subtext: "Complete your Rise Local Pass purchase."
- Order summary card showing:
  - Selected plan name (Monthly or Yearly)
  - Price
  - Small line item: "Taxes: calculated at payment" (or "Taxes: $0.00" if we’re not calculating yet)
  - Total
- A secure payment card section:
  - If Stripe is already installed/used in the project, implement Stripe Elements (CardElement or PaymentElement) correctly.
  - If Stripe is not yet implemented, stub the UI with a “Payment details” card and a placeholder component, but structure it so Stripe can be dropped in.

2) Plan selection:
- The checkout page must accept a plan choice via query param or state:
  - /checkout?plan=monthly OR /checkout?plan=yearly
- Default to monthly if missing/invalid.
- Show a toggle / segmented control for Monthly vs Yearly.
- Switching updates the summary and the URL query param.

3) Auth + user info:
- Require authentication (must work with AuthBoundary).
- Prefill customer email if available from useAuth() (user.email) and display it as read-only.
- If user is not authenticated, they should be redirected by AuthBoundary (don’t duplicate guard logic).

4) Payment flow:
- Implement a “Pay Now” button.
- On click:
  - Disable while processing.
  - Validate plan selection.
  - Call backend endpoint to create a Stripe Checkout Session OR PaymentIntent (choose the simplest that matches existing code; if none exists, create a new backend route).
- Preferred: Stripe Checkout Session for fastest MVP.
  - Backend endpoint example: POST /api/billing/create-checkout-session { plan: 'monthly'|'yearly' }
  - Backend returns { url } and frontend redirects window.location.href = url
- Add success and cancel return URLs:
  - /checkout/success
  - /checkout/cancel

5) Create success/cancel pages:
- /checkout/success: confirmation UI + button “Back to Discover”
- /checkout/cancel: “Payment canceled” UI + button “Try again”

6) Database + entitlement:
- After successful checkout, user should be marked as having an active Rise Local Pass.
- If you already have a field like users.isSubscriber or users.subscriptionStatus, use it.
- If not, add a simple field in users table:
  - subscriptionStatus: 'inactive' | 'active'
  - subscriptionPlan: 'monthly' | 'yearly' | null
  - subscriptionUpdatedAt
- Add a webhook handler for Stripe (if feasible) OR for MVP, add a “verify session” endpoint on success page to confirm session and update user record.

7) UX details:
- Show a lock icon + “Secure checkout” label.
- Show small text: “Cancel anytime.”
- Make it feel like a mobile app screen (max width, padding, bottom CTA button).
- Ensure white background app-wide and no black text-on-black issues.

Deliverables:
- New page component(s) in client/src/pages/Checkout.tsx (and Success/Cancel pages).
- Updated routing in client/src/App.tsx to include /checkout, /checkout/success, /checkout/cancel.
- Any needed backend routes under server/ (create-checkout-session, optional verify-session).
- If Stripe keys are required, read from environment variables:
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (if webhooks used)
  - VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (frontend if needed)
- Add clear TODO comments where keys or webhook setup are needed.

Do not add any marketplace ordering/cart purchasing logic. This checkout is ONLY for Rise Local Pass subscription.
