You are working on the Rise Local app (React + TS). Build a clean, mobile-first FAQ page for the Rise Local Pass membership.

GOAL
Create a new FAQ screen at route: /membership/faq
- Must match Rise Local UI (white background, soft cards, rounded corners, subtle borders/shadows, Rise Local green accent).
- Mobile-first layout, max width ~680px centered, good spacing.
- Use an accordion UI pattern (expand/collapse per question).
- Include a simple header with a back button that returns to /membership.
- No external UI library additions unless already used. Prefer existing components in the codebase (Button/Card/Accordion/Separator). If an Accordion component does not exist, implement a lightweight one using <button> + local state.

A1: Your membership is tied to one account, but you can access it on any device by logging in.

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Each section should render as a card with the section title and a divider.
- Each question should be an accordion row: question text left, chevron icon right that rotates when open.
- Only one accordion item open at a time within a section (radio behavior).
- Add a sticky bottom CTA (optional but recommended): a full-width button “View Pass Options” linking to /membership.
- Ensure accessibility: aria-expanded, aria-controls, focus states, keyboard support (Enter/Space toggles).

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS
- Create a data structure for sections/questions and map render it (avoid hardcoding repeated JSX).
- No inline styles; use existing styling approach (Tailwind or your design system).
- Add the route to the existing wouter route tree in client/src/App.tsx (or wherever routes are defined).
- Add a link entry from the /membership page to this FAQ page (e.g., small text link under the price card: “Read FAQ”).

DELIVERABLE
- New page component file (e.g., client/src/pages/MembershipFaq.tsx)
- Router update to register /membership/faq
- Membership page updated with a link/button to FAQ
- Confirm routes compile and page renders correctly without layout overflow on mobile.
