I can see the issue - the email input field appears to be disabled or not properly initialized. Here's a comprehensive prompt to help you debug and fix this:

Debugging Prompt for Email Input Issue
Problem: The Business Email input field on the login page (riselocal.replit.app/auth) is not accepting user input. The field appears to be locked or disabled.
Please investigate and fix the following:

Check if the input is disabled:

Look for disabled attribute in the email input JSX/HTML
Check if there's any conditional logic that might be setting disabled={true}


Review the input's event handlers:

Verify onChange handler is properly connected
Check if there's any onKeyDown or onInput that might be blocking input
Ensure state update function is working (e.g., setEmail or similar)


Look for CSS issues:

Check if pointer-events: none is applied to the input or parent
Verify user-select: none isn't blocking text input
Look for readonly attribute


Check the component state:

Verify the email state variable is properly initialized
Look for any useEffect or other logic that might be resetting the value
Check if there's form validation blocking input


Common fixes to try:

jsx// Make sure your input looks something like this:
<input
  type="email"
  value={businessEmail}
  onChange={(e) => setBusinessEmail(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="you@business.com"
  disabled={false}  // or remove this line entirely
  readOnly={false}  // or remove this line entirely
  className="email-input"
  autoComplete="email"
/>

Check for form library interference:

If using React Hook Form, Formik, or similar, verify field registration
Make sure the field name is correctly registered
Check if there's validation blocking input


Browser console check:

Open DevTools Console (Cmd+Option+J on Mac)
Look for JavaScript errors when clicking the input
Check if any event listeners are preventing default behavior


React-specific issues:

Ensure you're not using defaultValue with value simultaneously
Check if component is re-rendering and resetting the input
Verify the input isn't inside a form that's preventing edits



Files to check:

Login/Auth component file (likely BusinessLogin.jsx or similar)
Any shared Input component
CSS/Tailwind classes applied to the input
Form validation schema if using one

Quick test:
Try changing the input to this minimal version to isolate the issue:
jsxconst [email, setEmail] = useState('');

<input 
  type="text"
  value={email}
  onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
/>
If this works, gradually add back your styling and features to find what's breaking it.
