You are working in the Rise Local codebase (React 18 + TS + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Express + TS backend, Drizzle ORM, Postgres).

Goal
	1.	Make the Browse deal cards render in the same visual style as the third screenshot (image-first card with “Save $X” pill + business name + deal title + region + “Redeem today” meta).
	2.	Fix why deal photos are not loading (currently showing icon/blank), and ensure the same image appears consistently on:

	•	Discover page deal modules
	•	Browse All Deals list
	•	Business Profile → Deals list
	•	Deal Detail page (when clicking a deal)

Requirements
	•	Each deal must have an image that reliably loads.
	•	If a deal doesn’t have an image, fallback in this order:
	1.	deal.imageUrl
	2.	vendor.bannerUrl
	3.	vendor.profileImageUrl
	4.	a local placeholder asset (e.g. /assets/deal-placeholder.jpg)
	•	Cards must be responsive/mobile-first and match the third screenshot style:
	•	top image with fixed aspect ratio (e.g. aspect-[16/9] or aspect-video)
	•	image uses object-cover, rounded corners
	•	overlay pill “Save $10” (or computed savings label) on the image
	•	title + category chip + business name + location meta line

Step-by-step tasks to implement
	1.	Audit & standardize data model
	•	Ensure deals table includes a nullable imageUrl (string).
	•	Ensure vendors table includes bannerUrl and profileImageUrl.
	•	Add Drizzle migration if fields are missing.
	•	Update create/edit deal flow in vendor dashboard to allow saving imageUrl.
	2.	Ensure backend returns the correct URLs
	•	Update all deal-related API responses to include:
	•	deal.imageUrl
	•	vendor.bannerUrl
	•	vendor.profileImageUrl
	•	vendor.name
	•	vendor.location (city/area)
	•	deal.category
	•	deal.savingsLabel (or enough fields to compute it)
	•	If images are stored as relative paths, convert to absolute URLs in API (based on request origin) so the mobile webview can load them reliably.
	3.	Fix image hosting/loading
	•	Identify why images fail:
	•	broken/relative URL
	•	blocked by CORS
	•	mixed-content http vs https
	•	missing static serving for uploads
	•	Implement a robust approach:
	•	If using local uploads: serve /uploads/* via Express static middleware and confirm Vite proxy config.
	•	If using external storage: ensure URLs are https and publicly accessible.
	•	Add defensive UI handling:
	•	use onError to swap to fallback image
	•	add a skeleton loader while the image loads
	4.	Create one shared DealCard component
	•	Create client/src/components/DealCard.tsx used by Discover, Browse, and Business Profile.
	•	Component props should accept the deal + vendor fields and internally resolve displayImageUrl using the fallback order.
	•	Style the card to match the third screenshot.
	5.	Unify rendering across pages
	•	Replace any old deal list UI in:
	•	Discover modules
	•	Browse list
	•	Business Profile deals section
	•	All should use the same <DealCard /> component.
	6.	Verify click-through
	•	Clicking any deal card navigates to /deal/:id (or your existing route) and the detail page also shows the same resolved image at top.

Acceptance tests
	•	A deal with a valid imageUrl shows that image on all pages.
	•	A deal without imageUrl shows vendor banner/profile/placeholder.
	•	No broken image icons.
	•	Cards look like the third screenshot on mobile width.
	•	Works on HTTPS Replit deployment.

Now implement these changes in code: migrations, API payloads, shared DealCard component, and page refactors. After implementation, list the exact files changed and what was changed in each.
