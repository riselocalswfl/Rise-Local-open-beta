A) Remove ordering/cart system (frontend)

Search and remove/disable all UI related to:

“Add to Cart”, “Cart”, “Checkout”, “Order”, “Order Summary”, “Order Details”

cart icons/badges in header or product cards

Remove routes/pages/components used only for cart/checkout/orders.

Remove any React Query hooks calling cart/order endpoints.

Make sure Deals browsing still works as the main consumer action (view deal, redeem, call/text, website link, directions, etc. — whatever we have).

B) Remove ordering/cart system (backend)

Find and remove/disable Express routes like:

/api/cart/*, /api/checkout/*, /api/orders/*, /api/order-items/* (or similar)

Remove related services/controllers and DB calls used exclusively for orders/cart.

If Drizzle tables exist for orders/cart, do not drop tables in a migration right now (to avoid breaking existing DB). Instead:

Leave schema as-is, but ensure nothing references these tables and no endpoints expose them.

Remove any seed/test data usage for orders/cart.

C) Vendor dashboard: remove Orders, Services, Events

In the vendor dashboard UI (tabs shown currently: Profile, Services, Orders, Deals, Events, FAQs, Settings):

Delete Services, Orders, Events tabs and any subpages/components/state.

Ensure tab counts update (no “(1)” etc).

Confirm the vendor dashboard still loads and edits:

Business Info (name, contact)

Deal management/listing (create/edit/delete deals)

Settings

FAQs can stay only if it’s actually used; otherwise remove it too.

D) Put Vendor Dashboard inside “My Account”

Update the top navigation:

Remove the “For Businesses” button entirely.

Keep Deals / Businesses / My Account.

In My Account route/page:

Add a “Business Tools” or “Vendor Dashboard” section visible only when user.role indicates vendor.

Render the vendor dashboard inside My Account (either as a sub-tab, accordion, or nested route).

Routing:

New canonical path should be something like /my-account/vendor (or nested under /account depending on current route naming).

Keep the existing /dashboard route but make it redirect to /my-account/vendor.

Access control:

If a non-vendor hits /my-account/vendor, show a friendly message and link to upgrade/apply (or redirect to /my-account).

E) Clean up copy + navigation consistency

Any references to “Orders”, “Services”, “Events”, “Checkout” must be removed from labels, menus, empty states, and helper text.
