Please update the Service section on my Home page.

Right now, the Services section only shows a blank card with a “View Services” button. I want it to display real service vendor cards pulled from my database, similar to how product cards display for Shop items. Scan my project for the files that control:

- The Home page layout
- The Services list component
- The Vendor / Service data model
- Any card components or grid components

and apply these improvements:

SERVICE CARD REDESIGN
–––––––––––––––––––––
Replace the blank placeholder with a scrollable or grid-based list of service cards. Each service card should include:

1. Vendor / Service photo  
2. Service business name  
3. Short description or tagline  
4. Category tag (ex: "Photography", "Fitness", "Home Services", etc.)  
5. City or service area (if stored)  
6. A button or clickable card area that goes directly to the vendor’s full profile page

The card styling should:
- Match the existing Rise Local aesthetic (rounded corners, soft shadows, green accents)
- Be responsive and look clean on mobile
- Use consistent spacing and font sizes
- Load the latest 3–6 service vendors on the Home page

–––––––––––––––––––––
ROUTING + CONNECTIVITY
–––––––––––––––––––––
Ensure that:
- Clicking a service card routes to the correct vendor profile
- All service data pulls from the correct service vendor collection or database path
- Cards dynamically update when new service vendors sign up
- The “View All” link still opens the full Services page

–––––––––––––––––––––
MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
–––––––––––––––––––––
On mobile:
- Display service cards in a single-column layout
- Ensure images scale properly and do not overflow
- Keep text centered or left-aligned with clean spacing
- Buttons should remain thumb-friendly and visible

–––––––––––––––––––––
CODE CLEANUP
–––––––––––––––––––––
1. Reuse any existing card components if possible (ProductCard, VendorCard, etc.)
2. If creating a new ServiceCard component, place it in the components/ folder
3. Export the card and import it on the Home page and Services page
4. Remove old placeholder card code
5. Show me:
   - The updated Home page file
   - The new/updated ServiceCard component
   - Any changes to routing or data fetching
   - A list of all files you modified

Make sure the final output is clean, responsive, and production-ready so users can browse Services easily from the home page.
