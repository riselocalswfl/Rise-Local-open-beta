Project: Local Exchange – MVP
Goal: Build a minimal, working web app with two pillars:

Marketplace (browse/buy inventory by vendor/product/category with filters)

Community (events + social feed + Fort Myers Spotlight)

Tech preferences (okay to suggest defaults):

Backend: Python FastAPI (or Node/Express if faster), SQLite via SQLAlchemy/Prisma for speed

Frontend: React + Vite (simple, clean), Tailwind for styling

Auth: email+password (JWT), roles: buyer, vendor, admin

Payments: stubbed for now (fake checkout) but keep a Stripe-ready abstraction

Deploy: run entirely on Replit; one-click run (npm run dev / uvicorn main:app)

Key requirements (MUST HAVE):

Entities & basic CRUD

User (id, name, email, role, city, created_at)

Vendor (id, owner_user_id, name, bio, categories[], city, delivery_options[], is_verified)

Product (id, vendor_id, name, price, category, images[], inventory, is_active)

Event (id, organizer_vendor_id, title, date_time, location, category, description, tickets_available)

Order (id, buyer_id, items[], total, status, fulfillment_method[pickup|delivery])

LoyaltyPoint (id, user_id, delta, reason, balance_after, created_at)

Spotlight (id, title, body, city="Fort Myers", featured_vendor_ids[], featured_event_ids[], start/end date)

Flows

Auth: signup/login/logout; JWT; vendor onboarding form; admin verify vendor

Marketplace: list/search/filter by vendor, product category, city; product detail; cart; checkout (mock)

Community: list/filter events; RSVP/ticket count (no payment yet); Fort Myers Spotlight banner/feed

Loyalty: on completed order, add points (+10 per order for now) and show user balance

Pricing model baked-in logic

Flat $150/mo vendor membership (no per-transaction fee logic yet; just a field vendor_plan = "founder").

Buyer 3% fee: show as a calculated line item at checkout (no real charge).

Admin

Simple admin screen: verify vendors, create/edit Spotlight, view metrics (counts)

Filters

By vendor, product category, event category, city; sort by newest/popular/price

Fort Myers spotlight

Dedicated section on homepage + /spotlight route pulling city="Fort Myers"

API endpoints (FastAPI examples):

Auth: POST /auth/signup, POST /auth/login, GET /auth/me

Vendors: GET /vendors, POST /vendors, GET /vendors/:id, PATCH /vendors/:id, POST /vendors/:id/verify (admin)

Products: GET /products?category=&vendor_id=&q=, POST /products, GET /products/:id, PATCH /products/:id

Events: GET /events?category=&city=, POST /events, GET /events/:id, POST /events/:id/rsvp

Cart/Orders: POST /cart/add, GET /cart, POST /checkout (mock: create Order, status=“paid”), GET /orders/me

Loyalty: GET /loyalty/balance, GET /loyalty/history

Spotlight: GET /spotlight?city=Fort%20Myers, POST /spotlight (admin)

Frontend routes:

/ (home: spotlight + search bar + categories)

/login, /signup

/vendors, /vendors/:id

/products, /products/:id

/events, /events/:id

/cart, /checkout

/spotlight (Fort Myers)

/admin (guarded)

Acceptance criteria (don’t skip):

Can create a vendor, add two products, see them on /products, add to cart, run mock checkout, and see loyalty points increase.

Can create an event and RSVP.

Fort Myers Spotlight visible on home and /spotlight.

Basic responsive UI with Tailwind (simple cards/lists; no fancy design needed).

Seed script creates: 3 vendors (bakery, kombucha, plants), 6 products, 3 events, 1 spotlight.

Nice-to-haves (only if time permits):

Vendor QR code link to vendor page

Saved vendors (“follow”) for buyers

Simple review text on orders

Deliverables:

Monorepo or two folders (/api, /web)

README.md with setup/run steps and test logins:

Admin: admin@local.exchange
 / Admin123!

Vendor: vendor@local.exchange
 / Vendor123!

Buyer: buyer@local.exchange
 / Buyer123!

Seed command (python seed.py or npm run seed)

Clearly marked places to swap Stripe later

Build this now. If a choice is ambiguous, choose the simplest working option and keep code clean and documented.
