You are working on the Rise Local vendor dashboard page “Manage Deals”. The current deal card UI is not mobile-friendly: the deal title wraps awkwardly (one word per line), action buttons overflow off-screen, spacing is tight, and the hierarchy is unclear.

Goal: Redesign the “Manage Deals” page + deal cards to be clean, thumb-friendly, and responsive on iPhone widths (375px), while keeping existing functionality.

Requirements
	1.	Responsive layout
	•	Ensure nothing overflows horizontally on mobile (overflow-x-hidden on page container).
	•	Use a max width container and consistent padding (ex: px-4).
	•	Deal cards must be full width and stack cleanly.
	2.	Header improvements
	•	“Manage Deals” title + subtitle on left.
	•	Primary CTA “Add Deal” on the right on desktop, but on mobile it should:
	•	either become full-width under the title (w-full sm:w-auto)
	•	OR become a floating/sticky bottom button (“+ Add Deal”) (choose the best UX).
	•	Keep Rise Local brand styling (green button).
	3.	Deal Card hierarchy (each deal)
Inside each deal card, show these sections in this order:
	•	Top row: Deal Title (left) + Status badge (right)
	•	Title should wrap normally and look good:
	•	text-base font-semibold leading-snug
	•	use line-clamp-2 (or 3) with ellipsis to prevent huge cards
	•	Second row (compact metadata):
	•	Price (ex: $10) • Category (ex: Fitness) • Location (ex: Fort Myers)
	•	Use smaller muted text and a clean “dot separator”
	•	Tag pills row: (ex: Free, BOGO) should wrap to next line gracefully and not force width overflow.
	4.	Fix action buttons (Redeem/Edit/Pause/Delete)
	•	Do NOT show 4 wide buttons in a single row on mobile.
	•	Replace with:
	•	A single “Actions” button or 3-dot menu (DropdownMenu from shadcn/ui) on the top right of the card
	•	Menu items:
	•	Redeem Code
	•	Edit Deal
	•	Pause/Resume (toggle label based on status)
	•	Delete (danger styled)
	•	Add confirmation modal for Delete.
	•	Keep Redeem Code easy to access (either first menu item or a small secondary button under title).
	5.	Status clarity
	•	Show a clear badge: Published / Paused / Draft.
	•	If paused, visually dim the card slightly (opacity-80) and adjust badge color.
	6.	Accessibility & touch targets
	•	Buttons must be at least 44px tall on mobile.
	•	Icons + labels where helpful.
	•	Avoid tiny icon-only buttons unless inside a menu.
	7.	Implementation details
	•	Use existing stack: React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
	•	Refactor the deal card component into something like DealCard.tsx for cleanliness.
	•	Ensure no logic breaks: existing handlers for redeem/edit/pause/delete must still work.
	•	Add line-clamp plugin if not already enabled OR implement truncation with CSS.

Deliverables
	•	Update the Manage Deals page UI and styling to meet the above requirements.
	•	Output the exact files changed and a short explanation of what was improved.
	•	Verify on mobile widths (320px–430px) with no horizontal scrolling.
