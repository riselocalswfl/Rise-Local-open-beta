You are working in the Rise Local codebase (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + wouter). I need you to redesign the Business Dashboard → Profile page to be mobile-first, structured, and appealing, AND ensure that everything a business enters shows up correctly on the public business profile that consumers see.

Primary Goals
	1.	Make the profile editor feel like a modern mobile app: clean sections, less scrolling, easy completion
	2.	Add clear save/feedback UX: sticky save bar, dirty-state, toasts
	3.	Enforce single source of truth so there is zero mismatch between dashboard data and public profile display

Non-Negotiable Sync Requirement

Every field edited in the Business Dashboard must render on the public business profile page (consumer view) from the same saved backend data.
	•	No hardcoded/duplicate fields
	•	No placeholder text appearing publicly if a field exists
	•	Public profile must hide empty fields/sections gracefully

Mobile-First Dashboard Redesign Requirements

1) Convert the long form into sectioned Accordion layout

Replace the long continuous form with a shadcn Accordion (only one open at a time by default) with section completion indicators (✅ when valid):

Sections (recommended):
	•	Basics (Business Name, Tagline, Bio)
	•	Contact (Email, Phone, Website)
	•	Location (Street optional, City, Zip)
	•	Social Links (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter/X)
	•	Hours (fast controls)
	•	Branding (Logo/Profile photo + Cover banner)
	•	Values (toggle + slider + value tags)

Add a “Continue” button per section to open the next section.

2) Add a sticky bottom action bar (mobile)

Add a sticky bottom bar on small screens:
	•	Primary: Save Changes
	•	Secondary: Preview Public Profile
	•	Show “Saving…” / “Saved” feedback and toast notifications
	•	Disable Save when no changes (dirty state)

3) Improve mobile input ergonomics
	•	Single-column layout, strong spacing rhythm, touch targets ≥44px
	•	Use proper input types:
	•	Phone: type="tel" + formatting (###-###-####)
	•	Zip: inputMode="numeric"
	•	Email: type="email"
	•	Website: type="url"
	•	Bio: show character count (keep 300 max)

4) Make Social Links compact

Render social links as a clean list (icon + label + input). Only show platforms that are filled on the public profile. Optional “Add social link” expansion is fine, but keep all supported fields.

5) Hours editor must be fast

Replace the current hours UX with:
	•	Toggle: By appointment only (if enabled, hide daily hours and show a short note)
	•	Otherwise each day includes:
	•	Closed toggle
	•	Start + End time inputs
	•	Add shortcut: Copy Monday to all

6) Branding uploads should look clean

For Logo and Banner:
	•	Responsive preview with rounded corners
	•	Upload / Replace / Remove actions
	•	Recommended sizes helper text
	•	Prevent overflow on small screens

7) Values section clearer
	•	Toggle: “Display local sourcing percentage on public profile”
	•	Slider shows live label: “Local sourcing: X%”
	•	Value tags: add/remove chips, enter key adds, render as badges

Public Business Profile Display Requirements (Consumer View)

Single Source of Truth + Field Parity

Refactor the public business profile page to consume the same business profile data as the dashboard form (same schema/field names). Ensure all populated fields display publicly:

Basics
	•	Business name, tagline, bio

Branding
	•	Banner + logo shown in the header

Values
	•	Local sourcing percentage ONLY if the display toggle is ON
	•	Value tags as visible chips/badges

Contact & Location
	•	City, Zip, Street address (only if provided)
	•	Phone, Website
	•	Email optional (only show if you add an “email visible” toggle; otherwise keep it hidden publicly)

Social Links
	•	Show only the icons/links for platforms that are filled in

Hours
	•	Show “By appointment only” when enabled
	•	Otherwise render readable hours; hide closed days

Public Profile Layout Order
	1.	Banner + Logo
	2.	Business name + tagline
	3.	Bio
	4.	Values (if enabled)
	5.	Contact & location
	6.	Hours
	7.	Social links

Never show on the public profile:
	•	“N/A”
	•	Placeholder text
	•	Empty sections

⸻

Technical Requirements
	•	Use shadcn/ui components (Accordion, Card, Button, Input, Textarea, Switch, Badge/Chip, Toast)
	•	Keep existing backend fields and API routes intact (no breaking migrations unless required)
	•	Use lightweight validation per section, but don’t block saving unrelated sections
	•	Ensure end-to-end works: load existing values → edit → save → public profile reflects changes immediately

⸻

Deliverables
	1.	Updated Business Dashboard → Profile page with the new accordion layout + sticky save bar
	2.	Updated Public Business Profile page that renders the same saved data (field parity guaranteed)
	3.	Shared types/interfaces and reusable components if needed:
	•	BusinessProfileForm (edit)
	•	PublicBusinessProfile (view)
	•	ProfileHeader, ProfileSection, HoursEditor/Display, SocialLinks, ImageUploaderCard, ValuesDisplay

Implement this cleanly without breaking other routes.
