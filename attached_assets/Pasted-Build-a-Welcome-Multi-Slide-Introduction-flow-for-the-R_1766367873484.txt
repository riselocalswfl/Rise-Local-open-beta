Build a Welcome + Multi-Slide Introduction flow for the Rise Local app that appears immediately after first install or first login, before users access Discover/Browse.

1️⃣ Welcome Screen (Slide 0 – Hero)
	•	Create a full-screen welcome page with:
	•	Rise Local logo and brand colors (clean, warm, hyper-local feel)
	•	A hero image showing a happy local customer supporting a small business (authentic, community-driven, non-corporate)
	•	Headline text:
	•	“Welcome to Rise Local”
	•	Subheadline:
	•	“The easiest way to support local businesses you believe in.”
	•	Include a primary CTA button:
	•	“Get Started”
	•	Include a subtle secondary CTA:
	•	“I’m a Business”
	•	Tapping either continues the onboarding flow but stores intent (userTypeIntent = consumer | business) for later personalization.
