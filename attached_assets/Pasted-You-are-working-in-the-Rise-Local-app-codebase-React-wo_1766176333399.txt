You are working in the Rise Local app codebase (React + wouter + shadcn/ui).

Goal: Redesign the My Account area to have exactly 3 tabs (and no other tabs/sections inside My Account), with a simple mobile-first UI and consistent navigation.

1) My Account Tabs (Only 3)

Update the “My Account” page to show only these 3 tabs, in this order:

Tab 1: Business Profile
	•	Label: Business Profile
	•	Purpose: Contains all public-facing business info (profile photo, banner, business name, description, categories, address/service area, hours, contact info, website, social links, menu if applicable, etc.)
	•	This content currently lives in the second tab from the right — move/reuse that exact form here.

Tab 2: My Deals
	•	Label: My Deals
	•	Purpose: Create/edit/manage deals attached to the logged-in business
	•	Show a simple list of existing deals + a clear “Create Deal” CTA.

Tab 3: Settings
	•	Label: Settings
	•	Purpose: Contains account/security/app settings (password/auth, notifications, billing/plan, logout, etc.)
	•	Keep it clean and minimal (group items, no clutter).

Remove/hide any other My Account tabs, business dashboard links, or “For Businesses” entry points that duplicate this.

2) Simple, Mobile-First Navigation
	•	Tabs must be clearly tappable with strong visual state for active tab.
	•	Default tab on load: Business Profile.
	•	Keep spacing and typography optimized for mobile.

3) Back Arrow Navigation on All Pages

Add a consistent top header with a back arrow on:
	•	My Account main page
	•	Business Profile edit pages / subpages (if any)
	•	My Deals list + deal create/edit pages
	•	Settings page + any settings subpages

Back arrow behavior:
	•	Use browser/app history when available (navigate(-1))
	•	If there is no history, fallback route should go to the My Account root.

4) Implementation Rules
	•	Do not duplicate business profile fields/forms — reuse shared components so onboarding + business profile settings show the same data and UI.
	•	Ensure business profile edits update the same canonical business profile record used across the app.
	•	Keep naming consistent: Business (not vendor) everywhere in UI.
	•	Make sure the tab routes work properly with wouter (e.g., /account/profile, /account/deals, /account/settings) and do not break auth guards.

Deliver the final implementation with clean component structure and no dead/unused routes.
