Refine the Rise Local Settings page (/dashboard or /my-account > Settings). Right now it shows low-value fields like raw Logo URL / Hero Image URL placeholders and doesn’t surface essential account info.

GOALS
1) Show only settings that matter to daily use of Rise Local.
2) Replace raw URL inputs with proper image upload + preview.
3) Make it role-based:
   - If the user is a CONSUMER: show Rise Local Pass status + manage subscription + preferences.
   - If the user is a BUSINESS/VENDOR: show business profile essentials + membership/deal essentials.
4) Keep the UI clean, mobile-friendly, and on-brand (Rise Local colors, simple sections, no clutter).

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX
- “Logo URL” and “Hero Image URL” should not be raw text fields.
- Website/Instagram placeholders should not override real values.
- Missing the “essential info”: pass/membership status, plan management, profile completion, and basic contact/profile fields users actually edit.

NEW SETTINGS PAGE STRUCTURE (NO EXTRA SECTIONS)
Use 4–6 clearly labeled cards/sections max.

A) Account (all users)
- Email (read-only)
- Display name (editable)
- Password change link/button (if supported)
- Log out button (keep)
- Delete account link (confirm modal)

B) Membership / Rise Local Pass (CONSUMERS)
- Pass Status: Active / Inactive (with renewal date if active)
- Plan: Monthly / Yearly (if active)
- Button: “Manage Membership” (opens Stripe customer portal or internal manage page)
- If inactive: CTA “Get Rise Local Pass” (links to checkout)

C) Personalization (CONSUMERS)
- Value selections (the values chosen at signup) editable (multi-select)
- Toggle: Deal notifications (on/off) if notifications exist
(If these tables/fields don’t exist yet, create minimal DB fields + API endpoints.)

D) Business Profile (BUSINESSES/VENDORS)
Show only the editable essentials:
- Business name
- Business type/category (dropdown) (keep this)
- Phone
- Address (or city/area if you don’t store full address)
- Website
- Instagram handle (validate: allow with/without @, store without @)
- Profile status indicator: “Profile completeness %” (compute from filled fields)
Do NOT show internal IDs.

E) Brand Images (BUSINESSES/VENDORS)
Replace Logo URL + Hero Image URL text inputs with:
- Logo uploader (square crop recommended)
- Hero uploader (wide crop recommended)
- Preview thumbnails
- Uses the existing upload system (/objects/uploads/...) but hides it from the user.
Store the resulting path in the same DB fields as before (logoUrl, heroImageUrl), but only expose upload UI.

F) Deals Quick Stats (BUSINESSES/VENDORS) — essential + lightweight
- Published deals count
- Member-only deals count
- Total redemptions (if tracked)
- Button: “Manage Deals” (links to deals page)
If redemptions aren’t implemented, show only deal counts and omit redemptions.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Use existing auth/session logic to load current user.
- Fetch settings on load via GET /api/me (or equivalent).
- Update via PATCH /api/me for user fields and PATCH /api/business/me for vendor fields (or reuse your existing endpoints—just keep it clean).
- Add server-side validation for website URL + instagram handle + phone.
- Show success/error toasts.
- Remove placeholder default values (no “https://example.com/hero.jpg”).
- Ensure the page works on mobile: stacked cards, sensible spacing.

DELIVERABLES
1) Update the Settings page UI to match the structure above.
2) Implement/adjust the API endpoints needed (GET + PATCH).
3) Replace image URL inputs with upload components using our existing upload storage.
4) Remove any non-essential fields currently shown.
5) Add basic tests or at least runtime checks to prevent “Invalid time value” style bugs (guard against null/undefined date fields when displaying membership renewal date).

IMPORTANT: Keep the page minimal and essential—do not add unrelated settings.
After changes, confirm which fields are shown for consumer vs business and list the endpoints used.
