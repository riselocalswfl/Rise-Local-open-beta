Audit the Rise Local app specifically for Apple App Store approval risks when wrapped with Median.
Focus on webview legitimacy, navigation integrity, native expectations, auth behavior, and rejection triggers.

Avoid feature ideas, redesign opinions, or growth suggestions.

⸻

🚨 APP STORE RISK SCOPE (STRICT)

Prioritize:
	1.	Apple “webview-only app” rejection risks
	2.	Navigation correctness (no dead ends)
	3.	Auth + logout correctness
	4.	Payments + subscriptions compliance
	5.	Broken UI / misleading interactions
	6.	Privacy & account requirements

Ignore:
	•	Marketing copy
	•	Visual polish unless misleading
	•	Feature expansion
	•	Performance micro-optimizations

⸻

🧭 STEP 1: WEBVIEW LEGITIMACY CHECK (CRITICAL FOR MEDIAN)

Evaluate whether the app risks being flagged as:

“A simple website wrapped in a native container”

Check and report on:
	•	Is all core functionality usable without redirecting to an external browser?
	•	Any links opening Safari unintentionally?
	•	Any “Open in browser” behavior during core flows?
	•	Pages that look like desktop layouts on mobile
	•	Missing native affordances (back behavior, safe areas, keyboard handling)

Flag anything that could cause rejection under:
	•	App Store Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality)

⸻

🧭 STEP 2: NAVIGATION MAP + BACK BEHAVIOR

Generate a concise navigation map including:
	•	All screens/routes
	•	Entry points (cold open, post-login, deep links if present)
	•	Header icons (profile, account)
	•	Bottom navigation tabs
	•	Modals vs full screens

For each screen:
	•	Allowed roles (logged out / consumer / vendor / admin)
	•	Expected back behavior

Explicitly test:
	•	iOS swipe-back gesture
	•	Hardware back equivalents
	•	Tab switching mid-flow

Flag:
	•	Dead ends
	•	Duplicate stacked routes
	•	Back actions that exit the app or jump unexpectedly

⸻

🔄 STEP 3: AUTH, LOGOUT & STATE RESET (APPLE-CRITICAL)

Verify:
	•	Logout fully clears session, cache, and premium access
	•	After logout → no lingering access to gated content
	•	App relaunch restores correct auth state
	•	Login routes users to correct role-based home
	•	No infinite redirect loops

Flag any ghost state, cached access, or inconsistent auth behavior.

⸻

💳 STEP 4: PAYMENTS & SUBSCRIPTIONS (HIGH RISK)

Audit Rise Local Pass purchase flow for:
	•	Clear explanation of what the user is buying
	•	No misleading “unlock” language before payment
	•	Immediate and persistent unlock after purchase
	•	No broken state if Stripe webhook is delayed
	•	Restore access on app reopen

Flag risks related to:
	•	Apple Guideline 3.1.1 (Subscriptions & digital goods)
	•	Any purchase flow that feels incomplete or confusing

⸻

👆 STEP 5: NON-FUNCTIONAL UI & MISLEADING INTERACTIONS

List:
	•	Buttons/icons that appear tappable but do nothing
	•	Profile or Account icons that fail
	•	Footer items that don’t navigate
	•	Actions that fail silently
	•	Placeholder UI exposed to users

Apple treats misleading UI as rejection-worthy.

⸻

🔐 STEP 6: PRIVACY, ACCOUNT & COMPLIANCE

Verify presence or absence of:
	•	Privacy Policy link
	•	Terms of Service link
	•	Clear account creation flow
	•	Clear logout flow
	•	Account deletion path OR instructions (required by Apple)

Flag anything missing or unclear.

⸻

📦 STEP 7: OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT & COST-EFFICIENT)

Return results as:

1. App Store Launch Blockers (will cause rejection)

2. High-Risk Issues (likely reviewer concern)

3. Medium-Risk Issues (confusing but survivable)

4. Passes / Safe Areas

For each issue include:
	•	Short title
	•	Location (route / file / component)
	•	Why Apple cares
	•	Minimal fix (1–2 sentences)

No filler. No repetition. No redesign advice.
