Replit prompt: Update Rise Local Pass “What’s Included” section for mobile conversion

You are working inside my existing Rise Local codebase (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, wouter routing).

Goal: Update the Rise Local Pass paywall/pricing screen to a more conversion-optimized, mobile-first “What’s Included” section using the exact copy below, and ensure spacing/typography looks great on small screens.

1) Find the correct screen/component

Locate the page/component where the Rise Local Pass pricing is shown (the screen that currently has a “What’s Included” list).

Identify the exact file path(s) and show me where you found it.

2) Replace the existing “What’s Included” block with this version

Section heading (replace the old heading):
Why You’ll Love Rise Local

Bullets (exact wording):

Save at local restaurants, shops & services

Exclusive members-only deals

Pays for itself with one deal

Discover great businesses near you

Reassurance line (place under the list and above the CTA, or directly under the CTA if that’s the current layout):
Cancel anytime • No commitment

3) Mobile-first UI requirements

Keep the list extremely scannable: 4 bullets only.

Use a clean icon style (either checkmarks or simple icons), but keep it consistent with the rest of the app.

Make sure line length fits on mobile (avoid wrapping where possible).

Add comfortable spacing: clear separation between heading, bullets, reassurance line, and the subscribe button.

Do not change the price, payment logic, or any subscription wiring.

4) Implementation details

Use existing design system components (shadcn/ui) and Tailwind utilities already used in the project.

Keep styles consistent with the Rise Local brand (simple, premium, not “coupon-y”).

Make the section reusable if possible (optional): extract into a small component like PassBenefits.tsx if that matches existing patterns.

5) Output

Show me the exact diff/changed files.

Confirm the screen renders correctly on common mobile widths (e.g., 390px iPhone width) without overflow.

Proceed by locating the current screen, then implement the changes.
