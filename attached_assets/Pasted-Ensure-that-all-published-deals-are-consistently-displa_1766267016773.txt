Ensure that all published deals are consistently displayed across the Rise Local app.

Deal definition & source of truth
	•	A deal is considered published when status = "published" and isActive = true.
	•	The Deals table is the single source of truth.
	•	Each deal is linked to exactly one vendor via vendorId.

Discover Page
	•	Display a feed of all published deals from local vendors.
	•	Sort by:
	1.	Featured / preferred placement (if applicable)
	2.	Newest published deals
	•	Each deal card should show:
	•	Deal title
	•	Deal value / offer
	•	Vendor name + profile image
	•	Distance or location (if available)
	•	Tapping a deal navigates to the vendor’s business profile, anchored or scrolled to that deal.

Browse Page
	•	Display the same published deals as Discover.
	•	Allow filtering by:
	•	Category (shop, dine, services)
	•	Location
	•	Deal type (percentage off, dollar off, free item, etc.)
	•	Filters should never hide a deal that is published unless the user explicitly filters it out.

Business Profile Page
	•	Show only deals that belong to that vendor.
	•	Only display deals with status = "published".
	•	Deals should appear in a dedicated “Deals” section on the profile.
	•	The deal data shown here must be the exact same data as Discover and Browse (no duplicated logic).

Data & UI consistency rules
	•	Use shared query logic or a shared hook/service for fetching published deals.
	•	Avoid hard-coded or duplicated deal lists per page.
	•	If a deal is unpublished or expired, it must:
	•	Immediately disappear from Discover and Browse
	•	Immediately disappear from the business profile

Performance & UX
	•	Cache deal queries appropriately using TanStack Query.
	•	Show loading states while deals are fetching.
	•	Show an empty state message if a vendor has no active deals.

Validation
	•	Test by:
	1.	Publishing a deal
	2.	Confirming it appears on Discover, Browse, and the vendor profile
	3.	Unpublishing the deal
	4.	Confirming it is removed everywhere instantly

The goal is one deal, one source of truth, visible everywhere it should be — nowhere it shouldn’t.
