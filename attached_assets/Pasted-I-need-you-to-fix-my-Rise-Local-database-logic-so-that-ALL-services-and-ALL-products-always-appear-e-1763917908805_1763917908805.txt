I need you to fix my Rise Local database logic so that ALL services and ALL products always appear everywhere they are supposed to.

Here is exactly what I need you to implement — please follow this step-by-step, and do NOT write any code for me to review, just make the changes directly inside the project:

1. Product & Service Ownership

When a vendor creates a product or a service, automatically attach the vendor’s ID to every ownership field the system uses.

Make sure the vendor’s ID is saved into all relevant fields such as:

vendor_id

ownerId

created_by or createdBy

product_owner_id

service_provider_id

userId

Whichever of these fields exist in the codebase, fill them all with the logged-in vendor’s ID.

This ensures products and services never become “orphaned.”

2. Vendor Dashboard & Vendor Profile Filtering

Make all vendor dashboards and vendor profile pages use the SAME ownership field to display a vendor’s products and services.

If needed, unify everything to filter using vendor_id consistently.

This ensures a vendor always sees their own products and services.

3. Public Shop & Service Pages

Ensure the public Shop page and public Services page simply show all items that are is_active = true.

This is already working — do not change it.

Just make sure the vendor-specific views use the same ownership field.

4. Backfill Existing Data

Run a one-time cleanup inside the database:

Any product missing vendor ownership fields → fill them using the existing vendor_id

Any service missing vendor ownership fields → fill them using the existing vendor_id (example in /mnt/data/service_offerings.json: service_provider_id is null)

This will repair all existing products/services so they show up correctly.

5. Auto-Validate on Startup

Add a lightweight check on server startup that scans all products and services and fills ANY missing ownership fields with vendor_id.

This prevents the issue from happening again in the future.

6. Success Criteria

When you are done, the following should be true:

A vendor’s products always appear:

In the Shop section

On their vendor profile

On their vendor dashboard

A vendor’s services always appear:

In the Services section

On their vendor profile

On their vendor dashboard

No product or service has missing or null ownership fields

All future listings attach perfectly to the vendor that created them

The issue can never happen again

Please complete all of this inside my Replit project. Let me know when everything is implemented successfully.
