0) Create a quick “Repro + Test” checklist (do this first)

Goal: Don’t “fix” things blindly—prove what’s broken, then confirm it’s fixed.

Make a tiny list:

Consumer: tap top-right profile icon → expected: opens Account/Profile screen (or login prompt if logged out)

Consumer: tap footer Account → expected: same as above

Tap Logout → expected: session clears + redirected to login/onboarding + can’t access locked screens without re-auth

Acceptance test (after every change):

Works on web preview

Works on mobile wrapper (if you’re using one)

Works logged in + logged out

1) Fix the non-functional Consumer buttons (profile icon + footer Account)
1A) Diagnose why they don’t work (most common causes)

Button has no onClick / handler

Handler exists but route doesn’t exist (wrong path)

Route exists but is blocked by auth guard or crashes

Icon is inside another clickable container preventing click

Z-index / overlay makes button unclickable (especially top-right)

1B) Standardize navigation to ONE Account destination

Pick one canonical route, like:

/account (recommended)
…and make both buttons go there.

Implementation tasks:

Confirm there is a real page/component for /account

Wire top-right profile icon → navigate("/account")

Wire footer Account → navigate("/account")

If you have separate vendor/consumer layouts, ensure consumer layout includes this route

1C) Add a visible “click works” debug fallback (temporary)

While testing, add a temporary toast/console log:

console.log("Account button clicked")
So you can tell if the click fires even if routing fails.

Done when:

Both buttons reliably open the same Account screen

No console errors

Works on mobile-sized viewport

2) Fix logout (and make it impossible to “half logout”)
2A) Identify where auth state lives

Logout fails when your UI and storage disagree. Common patterns:

Token/session stored in localStorage/cookies

User object stored in React context / Zustand / Redux

Replit Auth session stored server-side + client still thinks logged in

Task: Locate your “source of truth” for auth:

AuthProvider / useAuth() / session endpoint like /api/auth/me

2B) Implement a single logout() function

Your logout must do all of these in one place:

Client-side:

Clear local session data: token, cached user, flags like isPassMember

Reset auth state in your store/context

Redirect to /login or /

Server-side (if applicable):

Hit an endpoint like POST /api/auth/logout that clears the session cookie or invalidates session

2C) Add route protection that respects logout

If user is logged out:

Block /account, member-only deal pages, etc.

Redirect to login/onboarding

Done when:

Logout always returns user to login/onboarding

Refreshing the page does NOT log them back in

Account buttons while logged out lead to login (not a broken screen)

3) Make onboarding feel less “Replit” (Auth branding + Email login)
Option A (recommended): Turn on Email login + brand the Auth page

Steps inside Replit:

Open your Repl

Go to Auth pane

Click Configure

Enable Email

Disable any methods that push “create a Replit account” vibes (if you don’t want them)

Set:

App name: Rise Local

App icon: your Rise Local logo

What this accomplishes:

New users can sign up without feeling like they’re joining Replit

The auth screen looks like Rise Local (not a dev tool)

Option B: Keep Replit Auth but minimize Replit presence

Same as above, but keep only the login methods you actually want and brand it.

Option C: Replace auth entirely (best branding, most work)

Move to Firebase/Supabase/Clerk/Auth0 only if Replit Auth still creates too much friction after Option A.

This is a bigger refactor: sessions, protected routes, user DB syncing, etc.

Done when:

A new user can sign up with email and doesn’t see “make a Replit account” messaging

Your Rise Local name/icon are visible on the auth UI

4) App Store launch path (based on the Replit approach you were sent)

You don’t need to do everything at once—just line it up in order.

4A) Prep checklist (before wrapping)

Ensure deep links/routing work in mobile webview

Ensure auth + logout works in mobile webview

Ensure Stripe checkout flow works end-to-end in mobile webview

Set correct production URLs + env variables

4B) Mobile packaging steps (high level)

Choose wrapper approach (the YouTube flow you were given)

Generate iOS build

Add:

App icon

Splash screen

Bundle ID

Privacy policy URL

Test on a real device via TestFlight

Fix any webview-specific issues (cookies, redirects, popup blockers)

4C) Submission basics

App Store Connect listing: screenshots, description, keywords

“Sign in with Apple” requirement may apply if you offer other social logins (depends on final auth methods)

Privacy disclosures (especially if you track user data / analytics)

Done when:

TestFlight build installs and login/logout works cleanly

Checkout and member unlock flow works on-device

5) Suggested execution order (fastest path to “feels real”)

Fix navigation for profile icon + footer Account

Fix logout + route guards (this will also make #1 more reliable)

Update Replit Auth: Email + branding

Only then start App Store wrapping/testing (because mobile will expose auth bugs)

Copy/paste Replit prompt you can use (for your in-app Replit Assistant)

Paste this into Replit AI to implement in one focused pass:

PROMPT

Audit the Consumer UI navigation and auth/logout flow. The top-right profile icon and the footer “Account” button are currently non-functional.

Requirements:

Create/confirm a single canonical route for the consumer account screen (e.g., /account) and wire BOTH the top-right profile icon and footer Account button to navigate there.

Fix logout so it reliably clears auth state (client + server/session as applicable), resets any cached user info (including membership flags), and redirects to the login/onboarding screen.

Add/ensure route protection: when logged out, /account and member-only pages redirect to login.

After changes, provide a short test checklist and where the changes were made (files + functions).

Do not change styling except if needed to fix clickability (z-index/overlays). Prioritize functional correctness.
